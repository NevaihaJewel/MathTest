<h1>Math Test Program</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Designed to help users practice arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program generates random math problems, accepts user input, and checks the correctness of the responses. It calculates the total number of problems attempted, tracks correct answers, and provides a performance percentage at the end.
<br></br>
<b>Key Features:</b>

- User-friendly interface for selecting arithmetic operations.
- Random number generation for creating dynamic problems.
- Efficient use of control structures to validate user inputs and ensure accurate program flow.
- Modular design with separate functions for arithmetic operations and input/output handling.
- Error handling to ensure the division operation avoids division by zero.
- Results summary with the total number of correct answers and a performance percentage.

<h2>Languages Used</h2>

- <b>C++</b>

<h2>Environments Used</h2>

- <b>Windows 11</b>
- <b>Visual Studio Code</b>
